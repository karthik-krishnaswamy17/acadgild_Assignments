/*
 * Assume that class A extends class B, which extends class C. Also all the three classes implement the method test(). 
 * How can a method in a class A invoke the test() method defined in class C (without creating a new instance of class C).
 * 
 * Answer:
 * f.It is not possible to invoke test() method defined in C from a method in A.
 * 
 * We can either create and Object of ClassC or Create a reference of ClassC and initialise the ClassA Object 
 * else make the Class C method as static.
